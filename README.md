# Food Waste Tracker

This project represents my first solo attempt at creating a project that incorporates my newfound knowledge of integrating a database via SQL with Python. As an environmentalist, I'm passionate about reducing food waste, and this project reflects my dedication to addressing this issue.

## Overview

The Food Waste Tracker aims to help individuals track and manage their food consumption to minimize waste. The project includes two versions:

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The simple version of the tracker allows users to interact with the application via the command line interface.

2. **Web Application (WIP)**: In progress is a more complex version of the tracker that utilizes Flask, HTTP, and other technologies to create a web-based application with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Database Integration**: Utilizes SQL to manage and store data related to food consumption.
- **CLI Interface**: The command-line interface provides basic functionality for users to input and track their food consumption.
- **Web Application (WIP)**: A work-in-progress web-based version aims to enhance user experience and accessibility.
